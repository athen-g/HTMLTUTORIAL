#My first HTML Project

This is my first HTML Project.
I had no proper plans while making this and just wanted to get my feet wet.
I added all the features in it that I know of as of now and I feel ready to move onto learning CSS.
Before I do that I'll be making another HTML Project.
It will be properly planned and executed.
This is it for now.
I won't be coming back to this project here after.

Goodbye.
