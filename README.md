# My first HTML Project

This is my first HTML Project. <br>
I had no proper plans while making this and just wanted to get my feet wet. <br>
I added all the features in it that I know of as of now and I feel ready to move onto learning CSS. <br>
Before I do that I'll be making another HTML Project. <br>
It will be properly planned and executed. <br>
This is it for now. <br>
I won't be coming back to this project here after. <br>

Goodbye.
